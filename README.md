This application displays three 3D models (Cube, Pyramid and a Triangle Prism) by using PyOpenGL and PyGame

To view the models run the display.py file and when the pygame window is open use the left and right arrows to navigate to the different models

The controls to translate the model for Question 3 are as follows:
U = Translate the model on the positive y-axis
D = Translate the model on the negative y-axis
L = Translate the model on the negative x-axis
R = Translate the model on the positive x-axis
F = Translate the model on the positive z-axis
B = Translate the model on the negative z-axis


The controls to rotate the model for Question 4 are as follows:
H = Rotate the model on the positive z-axis 
Y = Rotate the model on the negative z-axis 
O = Rotate the model on the positive y-axis 
P = Rotate the model on the negative y-axis 
I = Rotate the model on the positive x-axis 
K = Rotate the model on the negative x-axis 

The controls to shrink/grow the model for Question 5 are as follows:
1: Grow the model on the x-axis
2: Shrink the model on the x-axis
3: Grow the model on the y-axis
4: Shrink the model on the y-axis
5: Grow the model on the z-axis
6: Shrink the model on the z-axis
